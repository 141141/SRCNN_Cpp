# SRCNN_Cpp
C++ Implementation of Image Super-Resolution using Convolutional Neural Network

### Introduction
**SRCNN_Cpp** is a C++ Implementation of Image Super-Resolution using SRCNN which is proposed by Chao Dong in 2014.
If you want to find the details of SRCNN algorithm, please read the paper:
Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He, Xiaoou Tang. Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution, in Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014
If you want to download the training code(caffe) or test code(Matlab) for SRCNN, please open your browse and visit http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html for more details.
And thank you very much for Chao's work in SRCNN.
